# Yours Truly

A personal website template built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Organized for writing, projects, and creative work. Deploys automatically to GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

```
./getting-started
./go
```

Then open a conversation with Claude and say: **"Help me make this site my own."**

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full guide.

## Features

- **Markdown-powered** — write in plain text, the site handles the rest
- **Organized your way** — folders for blog, projects, and writing (fiction, nonfiction, poetry)
- **Privacy controls** — keep drafts off your site, or off GitHub entirely
- **Auto-deploys** — push to `main` and your site updates
- **Fast and simple** — static HTML, no server, no tracking, no database
- **AI-friendly** — includes a `CLAUDE.md` that helps Claude understand the project and help you customize it

## Content privacy

|-------|---------------|---------------|
| `published: true` | GitHub + site | Yes |
| `published: false` | GitHub only | No |
| `src/private/` | Your machine only | No |

## License

This template is yours. Do whatever you want with it.
