Run, run as fast as you can
You can't catch me
I'm the Ginger Bread Man!

How many of us run run run
Because we're convinced if we slow down
Lord Farquad will pop out of the scenery and torture us?

But what if there is no Lord Farquad?
What if often the spills we take
are from running so fast in a panic
we don't ask how we're creating them?
Run run run
Do do do
Fix fix fix

It never ends

What if
Many of the pains we've had in life were from
not listening
not stopping
not feeling

don't go that way
slow down
be still

Just do what's in front of you.
That's all that's ever asked of us.
