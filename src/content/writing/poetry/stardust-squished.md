Yo
Yeah, you 🫶 hi

Thanks for stopping
and having this conversation with me

Do you realize
Each of us,
you, me, our neighbor
are all pieces of the Universe?

Pieces of stardust squished into these human bodies?
We're the cosmos
experiencing what it is to be human

We forget that we are the Universe
created to experience itself
It's like we're looking at ourselves
through the wrong end of a microscope
We forget which way is up
And what we're here to do

But at least for me

Everything changed
When I started to understand I am the Universe
Learning to Love itself
So of course
The Universe loves me
So why wouldn't I love myself?

Anyway,
I just want you to know
that I'm the Universe
sending you love

💖 Audrey
