"Oh, look! A ship!" Gwen points at a cloud, its shape like a boat with sails.

Camille tilts her head, giggling. "It's sailing with the wind! Delightful!" She touches her twin's hand as they lie on the grass. Breathing together, they sink into the soft grass, long-stemmed daisies sway around them.

"I love how daisies smell. They're so nice and simple," Gwen says, sniffing one.

Smiling, Camille turns to face her, quirking an eyebrow. "You love every flower, don't you?" Her grin gets bigger. "Even if they have thorns and prick you, you still think they're fabulous." She laughs, brushing a small scratch on Gwen's cheek from a blackberry bush that morning.

"Well... yeah. It's not their fault I got too close, right?" Gwen giggles. "I was just too greedy for their yummy fruit!" She laughs, sitting up to pull a container from her pack. She holds up a huge blackberry, as big as her thumb. "I know you love these." Leaning over, Camille touches the berry to Gwen's lips.

Gwen opens her mouth wide, snatching the berry with her teeth, her eyes sparkling with joy. She chews, then closes her eyes to savour the sweet taste. After a moment, in the warm summer breeze, she asks, "Why do the best berries have to be so prickly?"

Camille quirks her head, popping a berry into her mouth. "Mom says it's 'cause the sweet berries attract lots of bugs and animals. So they need to be tough to grow big for the seeds." She offers another berry to Gwen.

Grinning, Gwen takes the berry. "I'm so lucky you're brave enough to fight the scary bushes for me!" Laughing, she tosses the berry up and catches it in her mouth. She lies back down on the hill, a big smile on her face, a warm glow in her chest.

Camille flops down on the grass, twining her fingers with Gwen's. Breathing, they let the moments grow long, enjoying the air and the warmth. Finally, a bell in the far off distance started to ring and Gwen squeezes Camille's hand. "Dinner time! Want to race?" Hopping up, she throws the satchel over her shoulder, tossing the container and a hoodie into it.

Camille looks at Gwen quizzically, tilting her head. "Nah, you always win. Go ahead, I'll be there soon." With that, Gwen springs forward like a gazelle, her long legs reaching for the path as her braid flies behind. Smiling, Camille rises, grabbing her own bag and bends to smell the daisies. Picking a few, her heart warms to blossom into a smile. Feeling the forest wrap around her, she welcomes the quiet isolation of the forest she has known since before she could walk. Whistling a tune, she turns to the path, meandering towards the house. A feather here, a flower there, she arranges a bouquet. Poking her nose into it, she grins, loving the textures on her face. Slowly she wanders along the path, saying hello to the trees and plants as she goes.

Turning the last corner, the sun glints off the windows of her home. Gwen is laughing with Mom and Dad on the porch. As Camille walks down the path between the wildflowers, laughter and music floats to her. Her heart lifting, she skips up to the porch and hugs Mom from behind, putting the bouquet right beneath her nose. Mom dips her face into the bouquet, laughing as she feels the feathers and flowers on her face. Slipping her fingers above Camille's, she turns to face her daughter. Slipping an arm around her waist, she presses a kiss against her cheek.

"I'm so happy to see you, Camille. Welcome home!" The soft words hang between lips and ears, the appreciation and gratitude thick between them. Camille squeezes her Mom back, holding her tighter.

"Thanks Mom! I love you." Grinning, she nuzzles back.

Turning to her Dad, the large man takes a stride across the porch, arms open wide. Launching into him, Camille laughs as he wraps her in a bear hug and lifts her off her feet. "I'm always happy to see you. Thank you for coming back home." His beard tickles her ear and she pushes her nose into his neck. "Of course! I love you, Dad."

Setting her back down, she's suddenly aware of the smells from the kitchen. "Did you really? Shrimp? I can smell them from here!" She rushes into the kitchen to look at the kabobs of seafood and veggies.

"Your father was busy catching them all day! He brought in quite the haul and there's plenty to save for later." Mom laughs, picking up the platter of shellfish, she carries it to the table, setting it down next to a large plate of water melon. "Gwen, would you get plates? Camille, silverware and glasses? I'll grab the sun-tea in the fridge as well."

They bustle around, setting up dinner, then join hands, smiles glowing.

"I'm grateful for good food and my girls!" Dad's voice rumbles across the table. Looking to each of them, his eyes twinkle as a tear slips down his cheek.

"I've had an amazing day and I'm so glad to be here with you." Gwen squeezes Mom and Camille's hands, shining a bright across the table at her Dad.

Mom turns her face upward, squeezing the hands she holds and says "Oh to be me, what a wonderful dream".

"I'm grateful for late summer evenings." Camille finishes, her heart feeling full and light.
