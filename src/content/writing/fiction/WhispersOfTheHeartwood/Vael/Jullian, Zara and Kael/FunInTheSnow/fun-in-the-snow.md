Julian stares out the window, teeth worrying his bottom lip. In the glass of water on his desk, a perfect whirlpool spins—tight, controlled, mesmerizing.

"Julian." Orin's voice cuts through his focus. "What are the tenets of water manipulation? Julian?"

Sighing, Julian releases his concentration. The whirlpool stills instantly. "Concentration, intention, and a fluid nature." He crosses his arms and meets Orin's gaze, letting his voice flatten just enough to be respectful but not challenging.

They stare at each other. Julian settles deeper into his chair, slowing his breathing, refusing to look away first. "Is there anything I'm missing, Sir?"

Orin's jaw tightens. He looks out the window instead. "No. You're dismissed." Then he turns his back on the entire class.

"Leeeeet's go!" Kael's whoop bounces off the rafters, jolting everyone from their stupor. He shoves books into his bag and elbows Julian. "He was so demanding of you today! What was his deal?" His eyes narrow, noting Julian's furrowed brow.

Julian shrugs and swings his pack onto his back, jerking his chin toward the door. In the hallway, Zara falls into step beside him. "You know you don't have to please him," she says quietly, her voice just for him. "Honestly, I don't think you ever could."

Julian manages a wan smile but doesn't answer. He doesn't know how to explain that it's not about pleasing Orin, but he's not sure what it is about.

Kael bounds ahead, already bending moisture from the air into a loose snowball. "Forget Orin. You know what we need?" He grins over his shoulder, mischief lighting his eyes. "A distraction."

Before Julian can ask what kind, Kael flicks his wrist. The snowball launches—not at Julian, but directly at Zara's chest. Laughing, she stoops to scoop up a handful of snow. "Hey! Look! The bun cart is here!"

Kael spins just as her snowball smacks him square in the face. Laughing, Zara wraps an arm around Julian's shoulder. "Come on, I bet the icing's still hot." She pulls him toward the cart, humming a happy tune.

Julian shakes himself free and grabs her hand, racing her to the cart. "Hi Molly! Thanks for being out here—it's so nice after classes."

Laughing, Molly's curls bounce around her face. "Oh, honey, thank you! I love feeding you guys. Makes my whole week." Grinning, she hands out hot buns, icing dripping down the sides.

Zara takes a bite and her eyes close in delight.

Kael groans. "If you ever need help testing new flavors, I'm always here."

Rolling their eyes, Zara and Julian pull him away by the elbows. Zara skips ahead, her pigtail buns bouncing. "Come on! It'll be dusk soon and I want to get out to the fort!"

Licking his fingers clean, Julian grins and snaps his fingers before breaking into a run. Behind him, snow slides off a nearby building, covering Zara and Kael in white fluff.

Grinning, Zara flicks her hands. Julian's foot slides as the ground shifts beneath him. He rolls, laughter lighting up his face, and flicks his hand forward—the snow under him forming into a makeshift sled. Kael pushes Zara onto the sled beside Julian, then grabs her shoulders for a running start. Julian urges the sled forward with a pulse of water, and they fly toward a side gate, laughing as bumps jostle them into the wilderness beyond.

The trees close in around them as they leave the academy grounds behind. Here, the snow lies thicker, untouched except for the narrow trails carved by deer and foxes. Julian lets the sled slow as the ground evens out, and they glide to a stop near the base of an enormous oak.

"There!" Zara points up through the branches. Nestled in the crook of two thick limbs is their fort—or what will be, once they finish it. Right now it's mostly salvaged planks and a half-rotted tarp, but it's theirs. Grinning, Julian brings the sled to a stop at the root of the tree. Hopping off the sled, he flashes a grin to his friends and jumps to grab the lowest branch.
