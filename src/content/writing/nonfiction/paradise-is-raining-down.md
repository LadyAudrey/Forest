We've all felt it—this quiet ache, the universal tug that says we're not enough. It's a human thing: chasing worthiness, safety, love, like they're waiting for us to earn them. We push, we pull, we carry old stories and habits, convinced we need to fix ourselves to belong. But what if that's all a misunderstanding?

For years, I bought into the lie, twisting myself—and even others—to feel safe, carrying behaviors, echoes of a world shaped by poverty and fear. But here's the shift: I'm not broken. I'm a reflection of something vast, learning to love itself through every messy, beautiful moment.  I'm seeing we're already a vibrant part of the Universe loving itself. The chaos is just surface noise, cluttering the mind. Beneath the distractions, we're the witness, calm and clear.

When we slow down, we can exist beyond judgment. There, opposites blur, and we remember we're all one being.  That's where my art comes from. It's not about striving or proving—it's about witnessing. My work is me opening to what is, struck by the beauty and wonder and compelled to breathe it into life to share with you. Paradise isn't out there—it's here, raining down, and it is ours.

If this resonates, my Patreon's a doorway you can dive through—my art, creative process, poems, and videos lighting the way as signposts. It's a place for you to unwind, to find what's already yours. Slowly, a quiet community blooms, inviting all to share the unfolding. The free tier's the tide pools; the paid tiers plunge into deep water. Beyond lies your space to unravel, reclaim what's yours, opening to the beauty whispering through us all.
